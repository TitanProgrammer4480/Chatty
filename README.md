# Chatty - Real-Time Chat App

Chatty is a real-time chat application inspired by WhatsApp, allowing users to send and receive text and images. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a seamless experience for messaging with real-time updates. The frontend uses React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI, while the backend is powered by Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary for image storage. User authentication and authorization are handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for secure password hashing.
